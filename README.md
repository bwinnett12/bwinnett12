Welcome to my profile! I try to keep it a cozy place. Just imagine there's a warm fire and it's snowing outside. 
I aspire to work with data and bioinformatics in such a way to understand the ocean as a environment. 
Three greatest things about earth are culture, food, and the ocean.
I hope to learn more about them all!
